      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Neil Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930 in Wapakoneta, Ohio. He earned
        a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Purdue
        University in 1955 and a Master of Science degree in aerospace
        engineering from the University of Southern California in 1970.
      </p>
      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        Armstrong joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) in 1962 and was selected as an astronaut in 1963. In 1966, he
        commanded the Gemini 8 mission, which performed the first successful
        docking of two spacecraft in orbit. He also served as backup commander
        for the Apollo 8 and 11 missions.
      </p>
      <h2>Moon Landing</h2>
      <p>
        On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and fellow astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin
        landed the Apollo 11 lunar module on the Moon's surface, while Michael
        Collins orbited above in the command module. Armstrong was the first to
        step out of the lunar module and onto the Moon's surface, famously
        declaring, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
      </p>
      <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        After returning from the Moon, Armstrong continued to work for NASA,
        serving as Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics and as a
        member of the National Commission on Space. He retired from NASA in 1971
        and taught engineering at the University of Cincinnati until 1979.
        Armstrong passed away on August 25, 2012 at the age of 82.
